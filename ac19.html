      <h1 class="vh1">LIFE AFTER COVID19.
    </h1>
    <p class="vp1">The coronavirus is a nasty microbe that can do a lot of damage to your body. If your infection was moderate to severe, it is possible that the virus did some amount of damage to your respiratory system. Even people with mild infection have to be alert in the post-infection stage because symptoms of other health conditions triggered by the coronavirus may surface. The body becomes weak after having battled the dangerous virus for so many days. You may feel drained and lethargic, which is quite natural.</p>

  <p class="vp1">1.Take rest
    Most doctors suggest that you stay isolated for another 7 days, especially now that some studies have found that even if the symptoms disappear, the virus may still linger in your body. If possible give yourself a week of complete rest after recovery. A well-rested body can focus on healing. Get enough sleep because when you sleep, your body speeds up the recovery procedure. Do not resume your old lifestyle right away. Too much work, stress and anxiety will make you ill.

     <p class="vp1">2.Have a nutritious diet
        Food eases the path to recovery. The right kind of food will help you gain your strength back in days. Make sure your diet includes plenty of proteins such as lentil soup, legumes, seeds, nuts,  boiled eggs, and chicken stew. Proteins repair the body. Eat small portions for easy digestion. Don’t forget to eat at least 1 fruit a day. Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.
        </p>

    <p class="vp1">3.Check your blood oxygen level
        Continue to monitor your blood oxygen saturation level with your oximeter. Even if you have recovered from COVID, there could be lung damage that you don’t know of. If so, your oxygen level will fluctuate and dip below 90. You will need to visit the doctor.
