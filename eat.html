      <h1 class="vh1">HOW AND WHAT TO EAT?</h1>
      <p class="vp1">Choose green leafy vegetables <br>Add green leafy vegetables to your diet. They are a rich source of proteins, iron, calcium, and fiber. Green leafy vegetables are easy to prepare and quite appetizing too.</p>

      <p class="vp1">Include enough proteins in your diet <br>Proteins are vital for the body and should definitely be included in the diet. Broccoli, soybeans, lentils, asparagus, and spinach are some protein-rich foods. Low-fat dairy products are also a rich source of proteins. Ensure that your body receives the required amount of proteins daily.</p>

      <p class="vp1">Chew your food <br>Have you seen a cow chew its food? Its at least 40-60 times.</p>
      <img class="ac" src="chew.jpg" alt="After">
      <p class="vp1">Keep away from fast food and soft drinks <br>Although it may appease your taste buds, fast food usually does a lot of harm to the body. It can be unhygienic and also high on harmful fats like trans-fats. Also, carbonated soft drinks have a high sugar content which will lead to obesity, diabetes, and dental caries. Instead of these harmful drinks, refresh yourself with a glass of buttermilk or lemonade.</p>
      <img class="ac" src="junk.jpg" alt="After">
      <p class="vp1">Cook at home <br>Instead of ordering pizza from the joint around the corner, use your kitchen and make that dish you've been planning on having. Cooking at home is a very good investment as it lets you spend more quality time with your family. It's a great way of ensuring that everyone in the family follows healthy food habits. Also, it's a very good idea to sit cross-legged on the floor or a chair while eating. Try it!</p>
      <img class="ac" src="dosa.jpg" alt="After">
      <p class="vp1">Never skip your breakfast <br>Breakfast is perhaps the most important meal of the day as the body prepares itself for the whole day ahead. Make sure you eat a wholesome and rich breakfast before you step out of the house.</p>
      <img class="ac" src="dosa.jpg" alt="After">
      <p class="vp1">Boost your digestion <br>While knowing what to eat and how much to eat is important, it always helps if you can boost the process of digestion. Sitting in Vajrasna (adamantine pose) for a few minutes after having food helps you there. This yogic posture enhances blood circulation in the lower abdomen and improves the digestive process.</p>
